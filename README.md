# Investigating Decision Boundaries with K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Algorithm

## Overview:
This project delves into the exploration of decision boundaries across nine diverse datasets using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The main objective is to analyze the dynamic nature of these boundaries and how they evolve with changes in the K value.

## What's Covered:
- **Algorithm:** Utilization of the KNN algorithm for classification tasks.
- **Boundary Analysis:** Examination of how KNN delineates lines or boundaries to segregate different classes within each dataset.
- **Impact of K Value:** By adjusting the K value, which dictates the number of neighboring points considered during classification, we observe the adaptive nature of these boundaries across datasets.

## Key Insights:
- **Dynamic Boundaries:** Witness the fluidity and adaptability of decision boundaries as K values fluctuate.
- **Visualization:** Visual representation of boundary shifts aiding in better understanding of algorithm behavior.
- **Comparative Analysis:** Comparative study across nine distinct datasets to discern patterns and trends.
